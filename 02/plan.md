For a 2-hour session, considering you've already covered some scripting basics, a cool and achievable feature to build together could be a "Customizable Player Character" system. This feature would allow players to customize their character's appearance in the game, making the experience more personal and engaging. It's an appealing feature that introduces a variety of scripting and design concepts without being overly complex for a short session.

### Customizable Player Character System

#### Overview:
Players will have the ability to customize aspects of their character, such as clothing colors, accessories, or even special effects around the character (like a glow or particle effects). This system can be simplified or expanded based on the learner's comfort level and the game's needs.

#### Lesson Plan Breakdown:

### Introduction (10 minutes)
- **Brief Overview**: Explain the concept and importance of player customization in games.
- **Objectives**: Outline the goal to create a basic customization menu where players can change specific aspects of their character.

### Planning and Design (20 minutes)
- **Decide Customization Options**: Depending on the game type and current assets, decide on a few customizable options (e.g., clothing color, hats/accessories, particle effects).
- **UI Design Overview**: Discuss the layout of the customization menu, ensuring it's user-friendly and intuitive.

### Scripting the Customization Feature (70 minutes)
- **Creating the UI** (20 minutes): Use Roblox Studio's interface tools to create the customization menu, including buttons and color pickers for different customization options.
- **Scripting Customization Options** (30 minutes): Write scripts that allow players to change their character's appearance. This could involve changing colors, adding accessories, or toggling effects.
- **Testing and Iteration** (20 minutes): Test the feature in the game, debug any issues, and make necessary adjustments based on test results.

### Break (10 minutes)
- A short break to rest and prepare for the final part of the session.

### Finalizing and Feedback (20 minutes)
- **Polishing the Feature** (10 minutes): Make any final adjustments to ensure the customization system is working smoothly and integrates well with the game.
- **Gather Feedback** (10 minutes): Allow the learner to interact with the new feature, providing feedback on usability and functionality.

### Conclusion (10 minutes)
- **Recap and Discussion** (5 minutes): Summarize what was accomplished, discussing key learning points and how this feature enhances the game experience.
- **Next Steps and Homework** (5 minutes): Suggest further improvements or additional features the learner can work on independently, reinforcing the skills learned.

### Additional Tips:
- **Keep It Simple**: Given the time constraint, focus on a few customizable options to ensure the feature can be completed and tested within 2 hours.
- **Encourage Creativity**: Allow the learner to come up with ideas for customization options and how they might be implemented, fostering a sense of ownership and creativity.
- **Documentation and Resources**: Provide links to relevant Roblox documentation and resources for UI creation and character customization to support the learner's independent exploration after the lesson.

This project not only introduces new scripting concepts and UI design but also enhances the game's appeal by involving players more deeply in their game characters.

### Step 1: Open Roblox Studio
- Launch Roblox Studio.
- Open a new or existing project where you want to add the customization menu.

### Step 2: Enable UI Editing
- In the `View` tab, ensure that the `Explorer` and `Properties` panels are open. If they're not, you can open them from this tab.

### Step 3: Insert a ScreenGui
- In the `Explorer` panel, right-click on `StarterGui`.
- Choose `Insert Object` from the context menu.
- Select `ScreenGui`. This will be the container for your UI elements.

### Step 4: Add a Frame
- Right-click on the `ScreenGui` you just created.
- Choose `Insert Object` and then `Frame`. This Frame will act as the main panel for your customization menu.
- With the Frame selected, use the `Properties` panel to adjust its size, position, and appearance to your liking.

### Step 5: Add Buttons
- Right-click on the Frame.
- Choose `Insert Object` and then `TextButton`. This will be your first button.
- With the TextButton selected, use the `Properties` panel to customize its Name, Text, Size, Position, and Appearance.
- Repeat this process to add as many buttons as you need for different customization options, like changing skins, colors, or other character attributes.

### Step 6: Add Color Pickers
- For color customization, you can use `TextBox` for hexadecimal/RGB input or a series of `TextButtons` with different colors.
- To add a TextBox, right-click on the Frame, choose `Insert Object`, and then `TextBox`. Customize it in the `Properties` panel.
- For direct color selection, add multiple `TextButtons` as described in Step 5 and set their `BackgroundColor3` to different colors.

### Step 7: Scripting for Interactivity
- Right-click on the Frame and choose `Insert Object`, then select `LocalScript`. This script will control the interactions within your UI.
- Open the newly created LocalScript and write Lua code to define what happens when buttons are clicked or when colors are selected. For instance:

```lua
local button = script.Parent:WaitForChild("YourButtonName")

button.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
    print("Button clicked!")  -- Replace this with the action you want to perform, like changing a character's appearance.
end)
```

- Repeat similar scripting for each button or color picker to handle different customization actions.

### Step 8: Test Your UI
- Click `Play` in Roblox Studio to enter play mode and test your customization menu.
- Interact with the buttons and color pickers to ensure they work as expected.

### Step 9: Fine-Tuning
- Based on your testing, return to the editing mode and make any necessary adjustments to the UI elements and scripts for better performance or appearance.

### Step 10: Save Your Work
- After finalizing your customization menu, save your Roblox project to preserve your changes.

This guide provides a foundational approach to creating a simple customization menu. Depending on your project's complexity, you might need to explore more advanced features and scripting techniques in Roblox Studio.
